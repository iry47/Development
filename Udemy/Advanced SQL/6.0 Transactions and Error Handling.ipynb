    "**Transaction:** A transaction is a single unit of work. If a transaction is succesful, all of the data modifications made during the transaction are committed and became a permanent part of the database. If a transaction encounters errors and must be canceled or rolled back, then all of the data modifications are erased.\n",

    "**Acid Properties:** In computer science, **A**tomicity, **C**onsistency, **I**solation, **D**urability, is a set of properties that guarantee that database transactions are processed reliably. In the context of databases, a single logical operation on the data is called a transaction. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Atomicity:** Requires that each transaction be \"all or nothing\": if one part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction fails, and the database state is left unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Consistency:** Ensures that any transaction will bring the database from one valid state to another.\n",

    "**Isolation:** Ensures that the concurrent execution of transactions result in a system state that would be obtained if transactions were executed serially, i.e. one after the other.\n",
